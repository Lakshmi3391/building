# AWS EC2 Interview Questions and Answers (with Examples)

## 1. **What is Amazon EC2, and what are its primary features?**

**Answer:**
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that allows you to run virtual servers in the cloud. Key features:

* **Elasticity:** Add or remove servers based on your needs.
* **Instance Types:** Choose the right server type for your work, e.g., high memory or fast processing.
* **Storage:** Attach virtual hard drives (EBS) to store data.
* **Integration:** Works with other AWS services like S3 (storage) and RDS (databases).
* **Security:** Protect your servers with secure networking and user access rules.
* **Auto Scaling and Load Balancing:** Automatically adjust the number of servers and share traffic.

## 2. **Example:** Your website gets random spikes in traffic. How do you design it using EC2?

**Solution:**

1. Use **Auto Scaling Groups** to add or remove servers based on traffic.
2. Add a **Load Balancer** to share traffic across servers.
3. Use **Spot Instances** for lower costs and **On-Demand Instances** for consistent traffic.
4. Store images or static files in **S3**, and use **CloudFront** for faster delivery.

## 3. **How do you ensure your EC2-hosted application is always running?**

**Answer:**

* Distribute servers across different zones in the same region.
* Use Auto Scaling Groups to replace failed servers automatically.
* Add Load Balancers to share traffic and prevent overload.
* Regularly back up your data and create a recovery plan.

## 4. **Example:** You cannot connect to your EC2 instance using SSH. What do you do?

**Solution:**

1. Check if **Security Group** allows SSH (port 22).
2. Verify that **Network ACL** in the VPC permits SSH traffic.
3. Use the correct private key and username to log in.
4. Check the instance system logs in AWS Console for errors.
5. If needed, detach the storage, fix it on another instance, and reattach it.

## 5. **What are the pricing models for EC2?**

**Answer:**

* **On-Demand:** Pay only for what you use, with no commitments.
* **Reserved:** Commit for 1 or 3 years to get a discount.
* **Spot:** Save costs by using unused servers but they may stop anytime.
* **Savings Plans:** Discounted pricing for consistent usage.
* **Dedicated Hosts:** Rent a full physical server for special needs.

## 6. **Example:** Moving an application from office servers to AWS. How do you choose the right EC2 size?

**Solution:**

1. Use tools like **AWS Migration Hub** to measure your current server needs.
2. Choose EC2 instances that match your CPU, memory, and storage requirements.
3. Start small and scale up using Auto Scaling if needed.
4. Monitor performance with **CloudWatch** and adjust as necessary.

## 7. **How do you secure an EC2 instance?**

**Answer:**

* Use **IAM roles** to assign the correct permissions.
* Restrict access using **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs**.
* Encrypt data stored on the instance and transmitted over the network.
* Regularly update the operating system and software.
* Use key pairs for secure SSH access.
* Enable AWS tools like **Inspector** and **GuardDuty** to identify security risks.

## 8. **Example:** Your EC2 instance processes large files daily. How do you optimize performance and cost?

**Solution:**

1. Use **EBS-optimized** instances for better storage performance.
2. Choose instance types suited for heavy tasks, like compute-optimized instances.
3. Use **Spot Instances** for cost savings if tasks can restart.
4. Store files in **S3** for cheaper and faster access with **Transfer Acceleration**.
5. Use **AWS Lambda** to pre-process data and reduce EC2 usage.

## 9. **What’s the difference between AMI and Snapshot?**

**Answer:**

* **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** A template to launch new EC2 instances with pre-installed software.
* **Snapshot:** A backup of your EBS volume that you can use to create a new AMI or restore data.

## 10. **Example:** Your EC2 instance stops suddenly. How do you investigate?

**Solution:**

1. Check the **EC2 Event History** in the AWS Console.
2. Verify if Auto Scaling terminated it due to scaling policies.
3. Review **CloudWatch** metrics for unusual patterns before the shutdown.
4. Ensure IAM rules were not misused.
5. Use **AWS Trusted Advisor** to check for setup issues.

## 11. **What is the difference between public and private IP addresses in EC2?**

**Answer:**

* **Public IP Address:**

  * Assigned to an instance in a public subnet.
  * Can be used to access the instance over the internet.
  * Changes when the instance is stopped and restarted unless associated with an Elastic IP.

* **Private IP Address:**

  * Used for internal communication within the VPC.
  * Remains fixed throughout the instance’s lifecycle.

## 12. **Example:** How do you recover data from a terminated EC2 instance?

**Solution:**

1. Locate the EBS volume attached to the terminated instance in the AWS Console.
2. Detach the volume and attach it to another instance as a secondary volume.
3. Mount the volume on the new instance and access the data.
4. Create a snapshot of the volume for future recovery.

## 13. **What are placement groups in EC2?**

**Answer:**

Placement groups allow you to influence the placement of your instances to optimize performance or reduce latency.

* **Cluster Placement Group:** Instances are placed close together for high performance and low latency.
* **Spread Placement Group:** Instances are spread across hardware to reduce failure impact.
* **Partition Placement Group:** Instances are divided into partitions to isolate groups from failures.

## 14. **Example:** How do you ensure minimal downtime during EC2 instance updates?

**Solution:**

1. Use a Load Balancer to distribute traffic between multiple instances.
2. Create a new instance with the updated configuration.
3. Test the new instance thoroughly.
4. Gradually shift traffic to the new instance using the Load Balancer.
5. Terminate the old instance after ensuring stability.

## 15. **What is the difference between EC2 termination and stopping an instance?**

**Answer:**

* **Stopping an Instance:**

  * The instance is shut down, but the EBS volume remains attached.
  * You can restart the instance later without data loss.

* **Terminating an Instance:**

  * The instance is permanently deleted, and attached volumes are also deleted unless configured otherwise.

## 16. **Example:** How do you monitor EC2 instances effectively?

**Solution:**

1. Use **CloudWatch Metrics** to track performance metrics like CPU usage, memory, and disk activity.
2. Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** for threshold breaches (e.g., high CPU usage).
3. Enable detailed monitoring for additional insights.
4. Use third-party monitoring tools like Datadog or Nagios for advanced features.

## 17. **What are Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) in EC2?**

**Answer:**

ENIs are virtual network interfaces that can be attached to EC2 instances. They allow you to:

* Assign multiple private IP addresses to an instance.
* Attach or detach them from instances for flexibility.
* Enable separate network interfaces for different applications on the same instance.

## 18. **Example:** How do you handle EC2 instance failures automatically?

**Solution:**

1. Use **Auto Scaling** to detect instance health and replace failed instances.
2. Configure a Load Balancer to remove unhealthy instances automatically.
3. Use CloudWatch Alarms to trigger actions based on failure metrics.

## 19. **What are security groups and how do they differ from Network ACLs?**

**Answer:**

* **Security Groups:**

  * Act as a firewall for EC2 instances.
  * Control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
  * State-based: Responses to allowed traffic are automatically permitted.

* **Network ACLs:**

  * Act as a firewall for subnets.
  * Control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
  * Stateless: Rules must be defined for both directions of traffic.

## 20. **Example:** How do you configure high availability for a database on EC2?

**Solution:**

1. Deploy the database across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
2. Use a Load Balancer to distribute read requests to replicas.
3. Configure automatic failover using tools like Amazon RDS Multi-AZ or a custom setup.
4. Regularly back up the database using snapshots or backup tools.
